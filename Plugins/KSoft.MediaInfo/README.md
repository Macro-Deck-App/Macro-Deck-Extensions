# Plugin to store current media informations in Macro Deck 2 variables
This plugin stores the current Title, Album Title, Artist, Playing Status and Is Playing in Macro Deck 2 variables.
Then, you can use these variables in buttons, actions or states.

# Config Dialog
There is a config dialog where you can choose which informations you want in the variables, and which variables names.
New variable names or activation will take effect immediately, but when you disable or rename variables, the old ones
will stay in Macro Deck 2 with their last values, until you restart the App.

# Using the variables
You can use the variables to display the current title, artist or album on a button for example.
The IsPlaying information (boolean) can be used to display a different icon on the play/pause button regarding the current
playing status.

### This is a plugin for [Macro Deck 2](https://github.com/SuchByte/Macro-Deck), it does NOT function as a standalone app
